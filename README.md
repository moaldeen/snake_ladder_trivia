# Game instructions and rules section 

- The Snake and Ladders Trivia game offers an interactive twist on the classic board game. It features visually appealing game elements, including the board, dice, and player tokens, creating an engaging atmosphere. The game adds a unique dimension by using the ChatGPT API to present questions when players encounter snakes and ladders.

- Designed for two to four players, the game is overseen by a game master while other players interact verbally or through chat on platforms like Zoom or Skype. This encourages collaboration, social interaction, teamwork, and effective communication.

- While the game introduces some fresh elements, it maintains the classic Snake and Ladder gameplay mechanics. Players roll the dice, aiming to reach the top of the board while facing the challenges and surprises of snakes and ladders along the way.
